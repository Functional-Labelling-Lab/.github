abstract="Algebraic effect handlers are a recently popular approach for modelling side-effects that separates the syntax and semantics of effectful operations. The shape of syntax is captured by functors, and free monads over these functors denote syntax trees. The semantics is captured by algebras, and effect handlers pass these over the syntax trees to interpret them into a semantic domain.",

 abstract = {We provide a detailed, introductory exposition of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a powerful Markov chain method to simulate multivariate distributions. A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},
